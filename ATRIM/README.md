# Data Analysis and Applications in Signal and Image Processing

## Description

This repository contains the codes and algorithms developed during my specialization in **Data Analysis and Applications in Signal and Image Processing** at **Ã‰cole Centrale de Nantes**. I am currently enrolled in this course, so many updates will be added as I progress through different subjects.

The specialization covers the following areas:

- Signal representation and analysis
- Image processing and analysis
- Scientific computing and numerical optimization
- Statistical data modeling and analysis
- Multi-sensor data analysis
- Machine learning theory and practice
- Imaging and inverse methods
- Projects in signal and image processing
- Biomedical signal analysis
- Research and development applications
- Audio content analysis and information retrieval
- Biomedical imaging
- Time-series modeling and prediction
- Projects in signal and image processing

## Subjects and Practical Work

### 1. ATRIM - Image Analysis and Processing

This course focuses on the fundamentals of image analysis. Practical lessons begin with basic image processing techniques, such as morphological operations and image indicators, and extend to more complex methods like spatial and frequency filtering.

This discipline is the first in a series of courses in the field of image processing, which includes **Imaging and Inverse Methods**, **Projects in Signal and Image Processing**, and **Biomedical Signal Analysis**.

#### TP1 - Image Characterization and Morphological Operations
- **Objective**: Understand and implement:
  - Measures to quantitatively characterize an image.
  - Intensity transformations and visualize their effect on images and histograms.
  - Basic morphological operations.

#### TP2 - Linear Spatial Filtering for 2D Images
- **Objective**: Apply the principles of linear spatial filtering:
  - Based on convolution operations.
  - Using different filters to solve tasks like denoising, highboost sharpening, and edge detection.
  - Break linear filtering assumptions to find patterns in an image (e.g., locating Waldo/Charlie) using correlation, or to filter while preserving edges.

### 2. CSOPT - Scientific Computing and Numerical Optimization

In this course, we study the principal methods for optimizing functions, including iterative descent methods and trust-region methods for convex functions.

#### TP1 - Implementation of Optimization Methods
- **Objective**: Implement several iterative descent optimization methods with line search, comparing these methods using two classic examples:
  - Minimizing the Rosenbrock function.
  - Non-linear curve fitting.
  
Additionally, the **Numerical Inversion of the Laplace Transform** using constrained optimization is covered.

### 3. ARSIG - Signal Representation and Analysis

In this course, we explore various methods for analyzing systems, including spectral analysis, wavelet modeling, and analyzing heritage signals.

#### TP1 - Detecting Oscillations in Signals
- **Objective**: Detect oscillations in four unknown signals using different methods.
  - Analyze a problem of oscillation detection in signals, mainly observed in astrophysics, with the goal of studying signals acquired via cyclic windowing.

#### TP2 - Discrete Wavelet Transform and Image Compression
- **Objective**: Apply the Discrete Wavelet Transform for image compression.

## Future Updates

As I continue progressing in the course, additional subjects and practical exercises will be added to this repository. Future updates will include work on machine learning, time-series analysis, biomedical imaging, and more advanced signal processing projects.
